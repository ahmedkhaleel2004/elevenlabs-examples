# Twitter AI Twin Creator

Create an AI twin of any Twitter/X profile using ElevenLabs Conversational AI. This app analyzes Twitter profiles, clones voices, and creates AI agents that embody someone's online persona.

## Features

- üîç **Profile Analysis**: Get detailed summaries of any Twitter/X profile using Perplexity AI
- üéØ **Targeted Research**: Automatically identifies and researches key conversation topics for deeper knowledge
- üéôÔ∏è **Voice Cloning**: Record a voice sample to create an instant voice clone
- ü§ñ **AI Twin Creation**: Combine profile data and voice to create a conversational AI agent
- üí¨ **Natural Conversations**: Chat with AI twins that sound and think like their Twitter personas
- ‚ö° **Instant Setup**: No complex configuration - just enter a username and record

## How It Works

1. **Enter Username**: Replace `x.com/username` with `yoursite.com/username` or use the form
2. **Automatic Research**: The app immediately begins comprehensive research:
   - Analyzes the Twitter profile
   - Identifies top 5 conversation topics
   - Conducts targeted research on each topic
   - Builds a knowledge base (all happening in parallel)
3. **Voice Recording**: While research runs, record your 30-60 second voice sample
4. **AI Twin Creation**: Once both research and voice are ready, the app automatically creates your AI twin with:
   - Your cloned voice
   - Comprehensive knowledge from profile and targeted research
   - Deep understanding of key topics
   - Personality traits from the analysis

The parallel processing saves time - research happens in the background while you record!
